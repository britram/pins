                 Properties of an Ideal Naming Service
                    draft-trammell-inip-pins-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of necessary functions and desirable
   properties of an ideal system for resolving names to addresses and
   associated information for establishing communication associations in
   the Internet.  For each property, it briefly explains the rationale
   behind it, and how the property is or could be met with the present
   Domain Name System.  It is intended to start a discussion within the
   IAB's Names and Identifiers program about gaps between the present
   reality of DNS and the naming service the Internet needs by returning
   to first principles.

Internet-Draft                    PINS                     February 2016


2.1.  Name to Address

   Given a name, the naming service returns a set of addresses
   associated with that name, if such an association exists, where the
   association is determined by the authority for that name.  Names may
   be associated with addresses in one or more address families (e.g.
   IP version 4, IP version 6).  A querier may specify which address
   families it is interested in receiving addresses for, and the naming
   system treats all address families equally.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNS does this for the Internet via IN A and IN AAAA
   records.]

2.2.  Address to Name

   Given an address, the naming service returns a set of names
   associated with that address, if such an association exists, where
   the association is determined by the authority for that address.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNS does this for the Internet with IN PTR records
   within the in-addr.arpa. and ip6.arpa. zones.  Note the limitation of
   delegation on octet (IPv4) and nibble (IPv6) boundaries.  Cite
   workarounds.]

2.3.  Name to Name

   Given a subject name, the naming service returns a set of object
   names associated with that name, if such an association exists, where
   the association is determined by the authority for the subject name.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNS does this via IN CNAME, but doesn't handle the
   set case, and there are restrictions on the use of IN CNAME (with
   respect to NS and MX records, but not SRV?)].

2.4.  Name to Auxiliary Information

   Given a name, the naming service returns other auxiliary information
   associated with that name that is useful for establishing
   communication over the Internet with the entities associated with
   that name.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Most other RRTYPEs implement this pattern.]

2.5.  Name/Address to Auxiliary Information

   As a name might be associated with more than one address, auxiliary
   information as above may be associated with a name/address pair, as
   opposed to just with a name.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNS doesn't do this, does it?]

3.  Properties

   The following properties are desirable in any service providing the
   functions in Section 2.

3.1.  Authority

   Every association among names, addresses, and auxiliary data is
   subject to some authority: an entity which has the right to determine
   which associations between subjects and objects exist in its
   namespace.  The following are properties of authorities in our ideal
   naming service:

3.1.1.  Federation of Authority

   An authority can delegate some part of its namespace to some other
   subordinate authority.  This property allows the naming service to
   scale to the size of the Internet, and leads to a tree-structured
   namespace, where each delegation is itself identified by a subject at
   a given level in the namespace.

3.1.2.  Unity of Authority

   For a given subject, there is a single authority that has the right
   to determine the associations and/or delegations for that subject.
   The unitary authority for the root of the namespace tree may be
   special, though; see Section 3.1.4.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: The unitary authority for a given name in the DNS is
   its registry.  The existence of registrars complicates this somewhat;
   see below.]

3.1.3.  Transparency of Authority

   A querier can determine the identity of the authority for a given
   association.  An authority cannot delegate its rights or
   responsibilities with respect to a subject without that delegation
   being exposed to the querier.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: It is very hard to enforce a restriction about
   delegations on the side (i.e.  "I make this assertion 'cause somebody
   paid me to").  One could implement this in the current DNS by having
   the recursive also do a WHOIS, making information about the registrar
   available for local policy decisions.]

3.1.4.  Consensus on Root of Authority

   Authority at the top level of the namespace tree is delegated
   according to a process such that there is universal agreement
   throughout the Internet as to the subordinates of those delegations.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Today, this is the root zone.  But note that this
   property does not necessarily imply, as with the present arrangement,
   a single authority at the root, only that the process by which the
   root is changed and operated leads to a universally consistent
   result.]

3.2.  Authenticity

   A querier must be able to verify that the answers that it gets from
   the naming service are authentic.

3.2.1.  Authenticity of Federation

   Given a delegation from a superordinate to a subordinate authority, a
   querier must be able to verify that the superordinate authority
   authorized the delegation.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNSSEC does this.]

3.2.2.  Authenticity of Response

   The authenticity of every answer must be verifiable by the querier,
   and the querier must be able to confirm that the answer is correct
   according to the authority for the subject of the query.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNSSEC does this.]

3.2.3.  Authenticity of Negative Response

   Some queries will yield no association, because no such association
   exists.  In this case, the querier must be able to confirm that the
   authority for the subject of the query asserts that no association
   exists for the query.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNSSEC does this depending on how well you've set it
   up?]

3.3.  Consistency

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: frontmatter here]

3.3.1.  Dynamic Consistency

   When an authority makes changes to an association, every query for a
   given subject must give either the new valid result or a previously
   valid result, with known and predictable bounds on "how previously".
   Given that additions of, changes to, and deletions of associations
   may have different operational causes, different bounds may apply to
   different operations.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: TTL.  Additions faster than changes and deletions,
   which is probably the opposite of what you really want if you want
   name-service-based revocation of things.]

3.3.2.  Explicit Inconsistency of Authoritative Results

   Some techniques (e.g.  DNS CDN) require giving different answers to
   different queries, even in the absence of changes: the stable state
   of the namespace is inconsistent.  This inconsistency should be
   explicit: a querier should be able to know that an answer might be
   dependent on its identity, network location, or other factors.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: DNS doesn't do this.  Not sure how useful this really
   is in a world where people deploy anycast TCP.]

3.4.  Performance Properties

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: note that these have to do with name service
   dynamics, and that explicit tradeoffs here are possible and
   interesting.]

3.4.1.  Availability

   The naming service as a while must be resilient to failures of
   individual nodes providing the naming service, as well as to failures
   of links among them.  Intentional prevention of successful,
   authenticated query by an adversary should be as hard as practical.

3.4.2.  Lookup latency

   The time for the entire process of looking up a name and other
   necessary associated data from the point of view of the querier,
   amortized over all queries for all connections, should not
   significantly impact connection setup or resumption latency.

3.4.3.  Bandwidth efficiency

   The bandwidth cost for looking up a name and other necessary
   associated data, from the point of view of the querier, amortized
   over all queries for all connections, should significantly impact
   total bandwidth demand for an application.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: What we mean here is that approaches that flood all
   name mapping updates to the entire Internet are probably not
   acceptable.  Cite work on DNS traffic load to show that DNS has this
   property?]

3.4.4.  Query Linkability

   It should be costly for an adversary to monitor the infrastructure in
   order to link specific queries to specific queriers.

3.4.5.  Explicit Tradeoff

   A querier should be able to indicate the desire for a benefit with
   respect to one performance property by accepting a tradeoff in
   another, including:

   o  Reduced latency for reduced dynamic consistency

   o  Increased dynamic consistency for increased latency

   o  Reduced request linkability for increased latency and/or reduced
      dynamic consistency

   o  Reduced aggregate bandwidth use for increased latency and/or
      reduced dynamic consistency
